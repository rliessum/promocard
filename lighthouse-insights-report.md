## 🔧 Actionable Recommendations

### **High Priority (Immediate Action)**

1. **Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources**
   ```html
   <!-- Current -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   
   <!-- Recommended -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="critical.css">
   <link rel="preload" href="non-critical.css" as="style" onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">
   ```

2. **Fix Color Contrast Issues**
   - Audit all text/background color combinations
   - Ensure minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text
   - Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker

### **Medium Priority (Next Sprint)**

3. **Optimize First Contentful Paint**
   - Inline critical CSS
   - Preload important fonts
   - Optimize image loading above the fold

4. **Improve Accessibility**
   - Add meaningful alt attributes to all images
   - Ensure all links have descriptive text or aria-labels
   - Test with screen readers

### **Low Priority (Future Optimization)**

5. **Remove Unused JavaScript**
   - Analyze bundle with webpack-bundle-analyzer
   - Implement code splitting
   - Remove unused dependencies
